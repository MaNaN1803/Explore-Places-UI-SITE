In high season (nov-march) waiting times of two days are nothing exceptional\n- be warned: we had the impression that the capacity of the national park is at its abdolute limit in terms of absorbing tourists. It's solid mass tourism here.\n- if you do (night) walks: expect to stay in plain sight of the village and not to really enter into the forest. a 3 h tour lasts about 1.5 h. it's a pretty easy stroll.\n- the whole village is cramped with hotels and handicraft stalls. \n\nThink about if this NP really is a must on your itinerary. Most likely you won't see a huge amount of wildlife. Most likely you'll have a weird feeling to pay around $12 for a walk 15 m off the village road.\nThe mountains are nice, maybe it's worthwhile staying nearby in a less touristy place.

because of the road conditions although there is some  regular traffic on the road. There are plans to improve this road to be a major highway to Leh but as of now it's not. However, only short sections are seriously dangerous.\n\nMost parts of the road are dry clay and drivable even without 4x4, but it can become muddy if wet. Some parts are very steep and there is no possibility to pass with other vehicles. On the right side, steep land awaits to slide down and on the left side, the canyon waits for you.\n\nLook for coming vehicles far away (1-2 km!) and try to communicate to arrange who can drive or make space. Trucks of about 12 tons are also driving here. We also had to drive over rock slides which was no problem because we have 25cm between axis and road: a normal car might touch the surface in some situations. Our 4 ton, non 4x4 truck is 3m in height and a co-driver was absolutely necessary to check height-vs-rocks on some creepy parts. \n\n!!Don't drive while or after rain!! !!Don't camp on land/rockslide areas!!\n\nComing from Zanskar, at: 33.87512,76.85106 you have already passed the creepiest parts but the next pass is steeper than usual and dangerous if wet!  The rest of the Road is relatively easy to drive even the 5000m Singe-la pass is no problem. But Rain and wetness will change everything!\n\nThere is no gas station after Padum!\n\n2023 Fall update: The road has been greatly improved and the best path will be to go via the Zanskar Valley road past Nerak, and avoid Lingshed which is supposedly steeper. Some parts of the road are paved, but it is still narrow and dangerous with some crossings through sand or over small streams of water. This road can be completed with no issue in an autorickshaw.","Latitude":"33.72025","Longitude":"76.8808","Altitude":"3500","Date_verified":"2023-09-13 00:00:00 UTC","Open":"Yes","Electricity":"","Wifi":"","Kitchen":"","Parking":"","Restaurant":"","Showers":"","Water":"","Toilets":"","Big_rig_friendly":"","Tent_friendly":"","Pet_friendly":"","Sanitation_dump_station":"","Outdoor_gear":"","Groceries":"","Artisan_goods":"","Bakery":"","Rarity_in_this_area":"","Repairs_vehicles":"","Repairs_motorcycles":"","Repairs_bicycles":"","Sells_parts":"","Recycles_batteries":"","Recycles_oil":"","Bio_fuel":"","Electric_vehicle_charging":"","Composting_sawdust":"","Recycling_center":""},{"Id":"186723","Location":"Khaltsi, Leh district, Ladakh, India","Name":"This road to Zanskar can be seriously dangerous","Category":"Warning","Description":"This road to Zanskar is very beautiful but it can also cost your life - People actually die here because of the road conditions.\nHowever, there is some little regular traffic on the road.\n\nThere are plans to promote this road to a major highway to Zanskar but as of now its not.\nHowever only short parts are seriously dangerous.\n\n!!Don't drive while or after rain!!\n!!Don't camp on land/rockslide areas!!\n\nMost parts of the road are dry clay and good drivable even without 4x4, but they become muddy if wet. \nComing from Leh, if dry - the first 3/4 of the road are relatively easy to drive but especially at the last 1/4  after 33.89901,76.84762 you can expect some really creepy and dangerous parts, depending on the size of your vehicle.\n\nsome parts are very tall and there is no possibility to cross with other vehicles, while on the left side, steep land awaits to slide and on the right side the canyon waits for you.\nLook for coming vehicles far away (1-2 km!) and try to communicate to arrange who can drive or make space.\nHowever, trucks with approx. 12tons are also driving here.\nWe also had to drive over rock-slides which was no problem because we have 25cm between axis and road, a normal car might touch the surface in some situations.\n\nAlso mind: our 4tons, non 4x4 truck is 3m in height and a co-driver was absolutely necessary to check hight-vs-rocks on some creepy parts.\n\nThere is no gas station on until Padum!","Latitude":"34.28502","Longitude":"76.81526","Altitude":"3300","Date_verified":"2024-09-09 00:00:00 UTC","Open":"Yes","Electricity":"","Wifi":"","Kitchen":"","Parking":"","Restaurant":"","Showers":"","Water":"","Toilets":"","Big_rig_friendly":"","Tent_friendly":"","Pet_friendly":"","Sanitation_dump_station":"","Outdoor_gear":"","Groceries":"","Artisan_goods":"","Bakery":"","Rarity_in_this_area":"","Repairs_vehicles":"","Repairs_motorcycles":"","Repairs_bicycles":"","Sells_parts":"","Recycles_batteries":"","Recycles_oil":"","Bio_fuel":"","Electric_vehicle_charging":"","Composting_sawdust":"","Recycling_center":""},{"Id":"188638","Location":"Kilar - Hudaan Batori Road, Kowas, Killar, Pangi, Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, India","Name":"Raj Hotel","Category":"Hotel","Description":"Good average-priced hotel in beautiful location.
