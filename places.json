In high season (nov-march) waiting times of two days are nothing exceptional\r\n- be warned: we had the impression that the capacity of the national park is at its abdolute limit in terms of absorbing tourists. It's solid mass tourism here.\r\n- if you do (night) walks: expect to stay in plain sight of the village and not to really enter into the forest. a 3 h tour lasts about 1.5 h. it's a pretty easy stroll.\r\n- the whole village is cramped with hotels and handicraft stalls. \r\n\r\nThink about if this NP really is a must on your itinerary. Most likely you won't see a huge amount of wildlife. Most likely you'll have a weird feeling to pay around $12 for a walk 15 m off the village road.\r\nThe mountains are nice, maybe it's worthwhile staying nearby in a less touristy place.
